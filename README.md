# Neighborhood-Based Intrusion Detection System Using Agent-Based Modeling in NetLogo

## Overview

This project simulates a dynamic, agent-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using NetLogo 3D, leveraging neighborhood awareness and behavior history tracking to detect and escalate suspicious activity in simulated network environments.

Python is used to process and visualize data exported from NetLogo, analyzing detection speed and confirmed intrusions.

## Project Structure


## How to Use

1. **Run the NetLogo Model:**
   - Open `networ_intrusion_detect.nlogo3d` in NetLogo 3D.
   - Run the simulation and export the snapshots and logs as `.csv`.

2. **Analyze the Data in Python:**
   - Open `intrusion_detection_analysis.ipynb`.
   - Ensure your CSV files are placed in `python_analysis/`.
   - Run the notebook to generate summary tables and visualizations.

## Results

The data analysis pipeline generates:
- **Bar chart:** Detection speed across tests
- **Line graph:** Total confirmed intrusions at Tick 100
- **Data insights:** Evaluates impact of IDS count and malicious thresholds
